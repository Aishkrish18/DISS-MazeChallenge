# DISS-MazeChallenge

This is a project offered by a course at TUHH. The project aims at programming the Lego Mindstorm Robot using LeJOS API to solve its way through a maze. The robot solves the maze when it reaches/ detects the color provided by the user. The maze on which it moves is unknow although we were given some example maze patterns to test our code. The detailed tasks are listed in the lab sheets inside the folder. The project required us to program using Java and design the UML of the code.
